Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Server Certificate Creation:
============================
The server generates a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key.
The server creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which includes its public key and other identifying information (e.g., domain name, organization details).


Certificate Signing by CA:
==========================
The CSR is sent to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
The CA verifies the server’s identity and domain ownership through various validation methods.
Upon successful validation, the CA signs the CSR with its private key, creating a digital signature. This signed certificate includes:
Server’s public key
Server’s identity information
Validity period
Issuer (the CA) information
Digital signature created with the CA’s private key
Certificate Distribution:

The CA sends the signed certificate back to the server.
The server uses this certificate to prove its identity during the SSL/TLS handshake.


Client Verification:
=====================
When a client (e.g., a web browser) connects to the server over HTTPS, the server sends its certificate to the client.
The client already possesses the public keys of trusted CAs (root certificates) that are pre-installed in the browser or operating system.


Digital Signature Verification:
================================
The client extracts the public key of the CA from its pre-installed root certificates.
Using this public key, the client decrypts the digital signature included in the server’s certificate.
If the decryption is successful, the client knows that the signature was created with the CA’s private key (as only the CA's private key can create a matching signature for the included data).
This verifies that the server’s certificate was indeed issued by a trusted CA and that the certificate itself hasn't been tampered with since it was signed.
Trust Decision:

Based on this verification, the client decides whether to trust the server’s identity and proceed with the secure connection.
If any part of the verification process fails (e.g., the signature doesn’t match, the certificate is expired, or the CA is not trusted), the client will display a warning or error to the user.



============================================================= ENCRYPTION OF DATA EXCHANGED BETWEEN CLIENT AND SERVER ================================================

Client Encrypts Data with Public Key:
======================================
Once the certificate is verified, the client generates a symmetric session key (used for the actual data transfer).
The client encrypts the session key with the server's public key and sends it to the server.


Server Decrypts with Private Key:
=====================================
The server uses its private key to decrypt the session key.
Now both the client and the server share the same symmetric session key, which can be used for secure communication.
Secure Data Transfer:

All subsequent data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted using the symmetric session key.
Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transfer because it is faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption.
