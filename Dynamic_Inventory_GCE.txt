1. Install dependencies (requests & google-auth)
sudo yum install python-pip (For CentOS)
sudo apt-get install python3-pip (For ubuntu)
pip install requests google-auth
pip show requests google-auth


2. Create the YML inventory file (gcp.yml) and copy the below contents and please change the file according to your project and service account:

---
plugin: gcp_compute
projects:
          - [your_gcp_account]
auth_kind: serviceaccount
service_account_file: /etc/ansible/dynamic_inventory/service-account.json
keyed_groups:
  - key: labels
    prefix: label
  - key: zone
    prefix: zone
groups:
  group_name: "'label_name' in (labels|list)"
  

3. Test
ansible-inventory --list -i gcp.yml
ansible-inventory -i gcp.yml --graph

ansible remote -m ping

Note - Configure ansible.cfg file if you don't want to specify inventory while running playbooks
inventory = /etc/ansible/dynamic_inventory/gcp.yml
ssh_args = -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
You can pass it as command line argument while running the playbook:
ansible-playbook play.yml --ssh-common-args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
